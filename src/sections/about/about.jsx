              Hi my name is Benevanio or Bene tesla
              (name used in almost all my social networks).
              I'm a fan of physics, chemistry and mathematics,
              in the future I think about doing a degree in
              mathematics or something in physics,
              maybe a bachelor's degree in physics, Y
              es this is "I" the pleasure nerdðŸ––ðŸ––.
            </p>
