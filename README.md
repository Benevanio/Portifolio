# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio built using React.js and Sass. The mobile menu is implemented using the React UserState Hook, responsible for controlling the menu state via a ternary operator. The project structure includes the following pages:

- **Components:** Houses each application component and its respective style sheet.
- **Section:** A place to store sections and their style sheets.
- The entire page is rendered in `App.js`.
- Navigation is implemented using React Router Dom.
